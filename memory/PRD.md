3. **Sports Showcase** - Tab-based (Cricket/Football/Tennis) with images, AI overlay mockup, feature tags, stats
4. **How It Works** - 5-step animated timeline with IntersectionObserver reveals
5. **Live AI Dashboard** - Bento grid with live ball speed, decision log, heatmap, match stats, camera feeds
6. **Video Storytelling** - Main video thumbnail + 3 sport-specific thumbnails with play buttons, **opens video modal**
