      { type: 'paragraph', text: 'The integration of artificial intelligence into sports officiating represents one of the most significant technological shifts in competitive sports history. From cricket pitches to football stadiums, AI systems are now capable of making split-second decisions with accuracy that surpasses human capability.' },
      { type: 'heading', text: 'The Evolution of Sports Technology' },
      { type: 'paragraph', text: 'Sports officiating has always been a challenging endeavor. Human referees and umpires must process vast amounts of visual information in real-time, often under extreme pressure. The introduction of technologies like Hawk-Eye in tennis and DRS in cricket marked the beginning of technology-assisted officiating. However, these systems were limited in scope and required significant human intervention.' },
      { type: 'paragraph', text: 'Modern AI systems, like those developed by GamLens, take this concept to an entirely new level. Using computer vision models trained on millions of professional match frames, these systems can track balls, players, and field markers simultaneously across multiple camera feeds.' },
      { type: 'heading', text: 'How AI Officiating Works' },
      { type: 'paragraph', text: 'The process begins with ultra-high-speed cameras positioned around the venue, capturing every angle at 240 frames per second. Computer vision algorithms then identify and track every moving object in real-time. Physics-based prediction models calculate trajectories, bounce points, and potential outcomes.' },
      { type: 'paragraph', text: 'The decision engine applies sport-specific rules to this data, generating instant, accurate decisions with confidence scoring. When confidence is below a threshold, the system flags the decision for human review, providing supporting visual evidence to help officials make the final call.' },
      { type: 'heading', text: 'The Numbers Speak' },
      { type: 'paragraph', text: 'GamLens systems achieve 95% decision accuracy across supported sports, with response times under 50 milliseconds. This level of performance eliminates the controversial calls that have plagued sports for decades, while maintaining the human element that makes sports compelling.' },
      { type: 'heading', text: 'Looking Ahead' },
      { type: 'paragraph', text: 'The future of AI in sports extends beyond officiating. Predictive analytics, player performance optimization, injury prevention, and fan engagement are all areas where AI will play an increasingly important role. GamLens is at the forefront of this revolution, developing systems that enhance the integrity and excitement of competitive sports worldwide.' },

      { type: 'paragraph', text: 'Studies show that even elite officials make incorrect calls 5-8% of the time. Factors like fatigue, viewing angle, pressure, and cognitive bias all contribute to inconsistency. In high-stakes matches, a single wrong call can determine outcomes worth millions.' },

      { type: 'paragraph', text: 'Our system combines multiple AI models working in parallel. Object detection identifies and tracks the ball and players. Physics models predict trajectories and outcomes. Rule engines apply sport-specific regulations. And confidence scoring ensures that borderline cases receive appropriate human oversight.' },
